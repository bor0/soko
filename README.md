Soko v1.0 by Boro Sitnikovski
=============================

This program is intended for demonstration purposes only.  I wrote this project in about 2 hours.

Write "make deps" to install dependencies.  I know that "configure" should handle this, but it's a small project anyway.

Write "make package" to make a .tar.gz archive of the binary files.

Write "make" to get soko executable.

Write "./soko 1" or "./soko 2" to run soko with level 1.dat and 2.dat, respectively.

TODO:
- render() is handling victory, while it is supposed to do rendering only. I did this to avoid parsing the matrix more than once.
- Use configure instead of make?
